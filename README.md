# Encryption Lab

You share a computer with other users at work. You want to secure the contents of the Finances folder so that unauthorized users cannot view its contents.

In this lab, the task was to:

Encrypt the D:\Finances folder and all of its contents.
Give file access to a specific user (access to the encrypted D:\Finances\2023report.xls file) by adding the encryption certificate.
